# The sharp Weil theorem actually used by the paper

A useful correction to the project architecture: LN97 Theorem 6.53 is a
coarser Stepanov point-count estimate.  It is valuable infrastructure, but
its constant is not the sharp `(r-1) sqrt(q)` estimate used in Sections 5,
7, 12, and 14 of the paper.

The sharp multiplicative-character theorem (the paper's Theorem 5.1 /
LN97 Ch. 5) is obtained from the split L-polynomial representation and
the power-sum lemma, using Theorem 6.53 for the coarse extension-field bounds.

`Weil.SharpQuadratic.sharp_quadratic_weil` now proves the quadratic
interface below in odd characteristic. `Weil.SharpMultiplicative` proves
both arbitrary-character interfaces, including repeated-root products.

This file gives the precise Lean interfaces for split squarefree
polynomials and for products with positive exponents. The latter is needed
for general powers; the squarefree version alone does not cover Section 14.

variable {F : Type*} [Field F] [Fintype F] [DecidableEq F]

/-- Sharp Weil bound for a product of distinct linear factors.

The product is written as `prod_i (x - root_i)`.  Multiplying by a nonzero
constant does not change the norm of a multiplicative-character sum, so this
is the exact form needed for products `prod_i (1 + lambda_i t)`. -/

/-- The split Weil bound with multiplicities, as required in Sections 12
and 14. All listed roots actually occur, and at least one multiplicity is
not divisible by the order of the character. In particular the product
cannot be an `orderOf chi`-th power over the algebraic closure. -/
