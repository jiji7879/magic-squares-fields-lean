# LN97 Chapter 6: hyperderivatives / Hasse derivatives

Lidl--Niederreiter call the maps `E^(n)` on p. 303 "hyperderivatives".
Mathlib's `Polynomial.hasseDeriv n` is exactly the same operator:

  D_n (Σ_j a_j X^j) = Σ_j (j.choose n) a_j X^(j-n).

This file begins the formalization of §§6.47--6.51 of LN97.

/-- LN97 Lemma 6.47 for two factors.

The book states the corresponding formula for an arbitrary finite product.
Mathlib already proves the two-factor Leibniz rule for Hasse derivatives;
the finite-product form can be obtained from this by induction when it is
needed in the proof of LN97 6.49/6.52. -/

/-- A divisibility form of LN97 Lemma 6.51.

If the first `M` Hasse derivatives vanish at `c`, then `(X - c)^M`
divides `f`.  This statement is valid even when `f = 0`, and is the
cleanest formal version of "c is a root of multiplicity at least M".

Instead of reproducing LN97's coefficient expansion around `c` by hand,
we use mathlib's Taylor operator.  Its `n`th coefficient is exactly the
value at `c` of the `n`th Hasse derivative. -/

/-- LN97 Lemma 6.51 in mathlib's `rootMultiplicity` language.

For a nonzero polynomial, the preceding divisibility statement is
equivalent to saying that the root multiplicity at `c` is at least `M`. -/
