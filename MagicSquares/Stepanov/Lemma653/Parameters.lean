# Parameter arithmetic at the start of LN97 Theorem 6.53

Theorem 6.53 chooses

    M = floor(sqrt(2q/m)) - 3

and, under `q ≥ 100 m k^2`, derives the coarse lower bounds needed to
apply Lemma 6.52.

This file isolates the elementary real inequalities so that the later
finite-field counting proof does not have to redo them.
`MultiplicityChoice` supplies the integer parameter used in the completed
proof, via the alternative choice `M = ceil(sqrt(q/m))`.
