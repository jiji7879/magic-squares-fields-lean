# LN97 Lemma 6.46: block elimination

This file formalizes the "base-q block" part of Lemma 6.46 on
pp. 301--303 of Lidl--Niederreiter.

The coefficients

    h_i(x) = e_{i,0}(x) + e_{i,1}(x) x^q + ... + e_{i,u}(x) x^{qu}

are represented by a polynomial `E i : F[x][z]`, and then `z` is
specialized to `x^q`.  Thus

    blockEval q (E i) = h_i.

The difficult algebraic input in the first block is isolated below as
`QuotientPowerIndependent`.  It says that modulo `x^q`, the powers
`1,g,...,g^(m-1)` are independent for coefficient polynomials in the
degree range appearing in LN97.  The remainder of Lemma 6.46 -- namely,
peeling the q-blocks one by one -- is proved here without any further
irreducibility assumptions.

`FirstBlockIndependence` derives `QuotientPowerIndependent` from
normalized Kummer irreducibility using the orbit-product argument.
`Complete` assembles this with absolute irreducibility and translation
to prove the full statement of LN97 6.46.
